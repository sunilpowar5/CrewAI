1.  **Paper Title**: AI Agents and Agentic AI-Navigating a Plethora of Concepts for Future Manufacturing

2.  **Key Contributions**:
    *   Provides a systematic review of the evolution of AI and AI agent technologies.
    *   Examines and clarifies the core concepts and technological advancements of emerging AI paradigms, specifically LLM-Agents (Large Language Model-based AI Agents), MLLM-Agents (Multimodal Large Language Model-based AI Agents), and Agentic AI.
    *   Explores the potential applications and integration strategies of these advanced AI agents into smart manufacturing environments.
    *   Identifies and discusses the potential challenges that may arise during the adoption and implementation of these AI technologies in manufacturing.
    *   Aims to address the current ambiguity regarding definitions, capability boundaries, and practical applications of these AI paradigms in the context of smart manufacturing.

3.  **Methodology Overview**:
    The paper employs a systematic review approach. It analyzes existing literature and concepts to:
    *   Trace the historical evolution of AI and AI agent technologies.
    *   Deconstruct and define the core concepts of LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI.
    *   Synthesize information on the technological advancements driving these paradigms (e.g., improvements in generative AI, LLMs, MLLMs for semantic comprehension, reasoning, and decision-making).
    *   Conceptualize and propose potential application scenarios within various aspects of manufacturing.
    *   Identify and categorize potential technical, operational, and strategic challenges for integration.
    This is primarily a conceptual and analytical review paper rather than one presenting new empirical data.

4.  **Key Results**:
    As a review paper, the "results" are the clarified understanding and frameworks it presents:
    *   A comprehensive conceptual framework distinguishing and interlinking LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, highlighting their unique contributions to information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous decision-making.
    *   Identification of new avenues for smart manufacturing enabled by these advanced AI agents, expanding capabilities in areas previously limited by traditional AI.
    *   A structured overview of potential applications of these agentic AI paradigms across various manufacturing functions (though specific applications are implied to be explored rather than exhaustively listed in the abstract).
    *   An outline of the significant challenges that need to be addressed for the successful adoption and integration of these technologies into manufacturing.
    *   The paper serves as a foundational resource for navigating the complex landscape of AI agents for future manufacturing.

5.  **Limitations**:
    *   **Lack of Empirical Validation**: As a systematic review and conceptual paper, it does not present new empirical data, case studies, or experimental results to validate the proposed applications or evaluate the actual performance/benefits of these agents in real manufacturing environments.
    *   **Conceptual Focus**: While providing clarity, the paper's focus remains largely conceptual. Practical implementation details, specific architectural blueprints, or detailed integration roadmaps for diverse manufacturing settings might be less emphasized.
    *   **Generality of Challenges/Solutions**: The identified challenges and potential solutions might remain at a high level without delving into the specifics of how they manifest or are overcome in particular manufacturing contexts.
    *   **Rapid Evolution of AI**: Given the fast-paced advancements in LLMs, MLLMs, and Agentic AI, a review paper published in 2025 might quickly become partially outdated regarding the absolute latest technological capabilities or emerging paradigms.
    *   **Scope Breadth**: Covering "future manufacturing" broadly might lead to less depth in specific manufacturing sub-domains or process types.

6.  **Suggested Improvements**:
    *   **Inclusion of Case Studies/Prototypes**: To move beyond theoretical discussions, incorporating real-world or simulated case studies, even as conceptual prototypes, would significantly enhance the paper's impact and practical applicability.
    *   **Quantitative Impact Analysis**: Where possible, provide frameworks or metrics for evaluating the potential quantitative impact (e.g., efficiency gains, cost reduction, quality improvement, safety enhancement) of deploying these agents in manufacturing.
    *   **Detailed Architectural Patterns**: Propose more detailed, generalized architectural patterns or reference models for integrating LLM/MLLM-Agents and Agentic AI into existing manufacturing IT/OT (Information Technology/Operational Technology) infrastructures.
    *   **Roadmap for Adoption**: Develop a phased roadmap for manufacturers of varying maturity levels to adopt these technologies, including considerations for data infrastructure, skill development, and change management.
    *   **Ethical and Societal Implications**: Expand the discussion on ethical considerations, job displacement, human-agent collaboration models, and regulatory aspects specific to the widespread adoption of AI agents in manufacturing.
    *   **Benchmarking Framework**: Suggest or propose a preliminary benchmarking framework for evaluating the capabilities and performance of different AI agent implementations in manufacturing.
